# Employment priority
 
Mod that allows setting employment priority on workplaces. Umemployed workers will fill up higher priority workplaces first.

If you need a workplace to have a worker immediately, you can click the 'employ now' button. This will grab workers from the lowest priority workplaces first.

This mod also works correctly with saved games and the priority assignment tool.
